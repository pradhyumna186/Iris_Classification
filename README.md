## Project Description
This project uses the classic Iris dataset to compare the performance of various machine learning classifiers:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

The project includes data exploration, visualization, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of multiple classifiers
- Model performance comparison

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
3. Run the script: `python iris_classification.py`

## Results
The project compares the performance of different classifiers on the Iris dataset, providing insights into their accuracy and effectiveness for this classification task.

## Future Improvements
